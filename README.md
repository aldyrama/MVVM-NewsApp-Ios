# MVVM-iOS-APP 
MVVM iOS Swift 4 

This is an example for Model View View Model, I used the API from https://www.themoviedb.org/. You can check how that is functional and  get  more clean code

Use Carthage: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

Installing Carthage
There are multiple options for installing Carthage:

Installer: Download and run the Carthage.pkg file for the latest release, then follow the on-screen instructions.

Homebrew: You can use Homebrew and install the carthage tool on your system simply by running `brew update` and `brew install carthage` . (note: if you previously installed the binary version of Carthage, you should delete /Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework).

From source: If youâ€™d like to run the latest development version (which may be highly unstable or incompatible), simply clone the master branch of the repository, then run make install. Requires Xcode 9.0 (Swift 4.0).
